// The event socket from terminumd (/fb/api/ws): a WebSocket, because a browser gives a page six
// HTTP connections per host and a held SSE stream would take one per panel (AC-41). The sign-in
// rides in its subprotocols. It opens only after terminumd proved that it knows the sign-in
// (AC 09): while terminumd is not running another program may hold its port. When it closes it
// is opened again after a new proof: at once while terminumd restarts (AC-16), then less often
// (up to every 2 s), and every 5 s while the proof fails. terminumd closes it too when this
// panel fell behind; the first message after opening is always the current state.
