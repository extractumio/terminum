# terminum — build and install from a checkout (users install the package:
# curl … install.sh | sh, then the terminum command; README).
#   make install    build the package from this checkout and install it (first install or
#                   upgrade; a build that does not come up healthy is rolled back)
#   make upgrade    the same
#   make rollback   back to the previous build
#   make uninstall  stop terminumd, remove the launchd agent, builds and command (keeps state, logs)
#   make toolchain  the pinned cross toolchain (zig, cargo-zigbuild) for the Linux builds
#   make agents     terminumd for the four platforms (AC-86)
#   make package    the release package in dist/package (tarball, install.sh, SHA256SUMS)
#   make release TAG=vX.Y.Z   tag HEAD, build, sign (key via ssh-agent and the Keychain) and
#                   publish; only when the maintainer asks for it (CLAUDE.md §10)
#   make signing-key       the maintainer's release key (once)
#   make test       unit tests (Rust, scripts, UI, page)
#   make test-mac   the macOS checks on the LAN's Mac test runner over ssh (scripts/ci_mac.sh)
