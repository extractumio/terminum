# Contributing

Thanks for helping. Read [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) first: it holds the project rules (English
only, the 500-line cap, tests and the Definition of Done) for humans and AI agents alike.

## Contributor license agreement

The project is dual-licensed (AGPL-3.0 and a commercial license, see
[LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md](LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md)). To keep that possible, every contribution
needs this agreement. By opening a pull request you confirm that:

1. You wrote the contribution, or have the right to submit it; if your employer has rights
   in it, your employer has allowed you to contribute it under these terms.
2. You grant Gregory Zemskov and any successors and assigns ("the Maintainer") a
   perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, modify,
   sublicense and relicense the contribution, including under the commercial license, and
   to transfer these rights.
3. You grant the Maintainer a patent license for any of your patents that the contribution
   necessarily infringes, on the same terms.
4. You keep the copyright of your contribution and may use it under any terms.

The agreement is recorded by a CLA check on the pull request (until it is set up:
`Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>` on each commit, `git commit -s`). This is for
pull requests from outside contributors only: the Maintainer's commits, and those of AI
agents working in the Maintainer's checkout, carry no such line (plain `git commit`): the
`commit-msg` hook refuses the author's name and email in a message (CLAUDE.md §2).

## Worktrees

Who needs a worktree and how to stay on a fresh `origin/main` is in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) §9.
Read-only work (a question, a review) and the `make release` command itself (the primary checkout's `main`) need none; a release's edits (`/simplify`'s fixes, its notes) land from a tree like any other.

| Step | How |
| --- | --- |
| Make | `python3 scripts/worktree.py add <slug> --kind feat\|fix\|test\|docs\|chore`: branch `<kind>/<slug>` named from the task (`fix/paste-newlines`, never asked for), from a freshly fetched `origin/main` (`--from <ref>`; it warns when `main` has unpushed commits), without upstream (a bare `git push` never lands on `main`), checked out in `<primary>/.worktrees/<slug>` (git-excluded); a tree made otherwise (`git worktree add`, Claude Code's own) gets the links below by `worktree.py link` in it |
| Linked | `.toolchain`, `local.mk`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, `project-memory`, `.claude/settings.local.json`: symlinks to the primary checkout's, one copy |
| Cloned | copy-on-write on APFS (a reflink on Linux, else not made): `ui/node_modules` when `ui/package-lock.json` matches the primary's (else `make` runs `npm ci`), `terminumd/target/release` without its binaries (the dependencies' builds: only terminumd compiles) |
| Own | `terminumd/target/debug` (a cold `cargo build`, about 30 s; the primary's is too big to clone), `ui/dist`, `dist/`, `.checks/`; shared by git itself: the hooks (`core.hooksPath`) and the stash (never a bare `git stash`) |
| Parallel | `make test`, `make check` and the checks that start terminumd or tmux run in several trees at once: each run takes a free port and a tmux socket `<name>-<pid>` (`scripts/testrun.py`, `web/test/testrun.mjs`). Docker's scripts name their containers `<name>-<pid>` and take free ports too. Trees share the machine's cores: the targeted checks and a landing build under `nice -n 10`, a new tree clones the primary checkout's dependencies' builds (debug and release), and a release's full run waits for a quiet machine (spec AC-146). |
| Install | the machine has one running terminumd, so `make install` runs from the primary checkout only (CLAUDE.md §8, §9; `TM_INSTALL_FROM_WORKTREE=1` is the maintainer's own try of a branch): a tree makes `make build` and its checks. `make install` fetches first (`scripts/worktree_fresh.py`; a failed fetch only warns), and leaves a branch other than `main` alone |
| Land | `make land SLUG=<slug>` from the primary checkout, the work committed: merge with `origin/main` in the tree; the targeted checks' pass on the tree's own content counts (`scripts/check_changed.py` keeps it in `.checks/changed-<id>.ok`; without one, or when `origin/main` changed the same files, they run on the merge); the smoke set on the merge (`check_changed.py --land`); push, the primary checkout fast-forwarded, the tree deleted (spec AC-104) |
| Finish | `worktree.py list`: each tree's branch, uncommitted files, commits not in `origin/main`, processes in it; `scripts/delete_worktree.sh <slug>`, or `worktree.py remove <slug>`, for a tree with nothing to land: it refuses while a process works in the tree (exit that shell or session; it ends nothing) or, without `--discard`, while the tree holds uncommitted changes, ignored files that are not build output, or commits on a detached HEAD; it deletes the branch only when it is in `origin/main` or `main` |
| Forgotten | `worktree.py sweep` (what it removes: CLAUDE.md §9): "its own work" is a commit or a real merge, looking through fast-forwards and rebases, not its creation or a reset; "idle" is no commit and no index write. It keeps `remove`'s refusals. A squash merge is not seen, nor are Claude Code's own `.claude/worktrees`. Its remote branch stays. `.worktrees/.git` is an invalid git file on purpose: a removed tree's folder made again finds it, so git there fails instead of working on the primary checkout's `main` |
| Hooks | `.claude/settings.json` runs the primary checkout's `scripts/worktree_fresh.py` and `worktree.py`, always exiting 0 and doing nothing in another repository: at a session's start `fresh --start` says the checkout, the branch (or a detached HEAD) and how far behind `origin/main`; at each prompt `fresh` says it for the primary checkout when behind, for a tree when it holds no work yet, `origin/main` changed files it changes, or `origin/main` changed how trees are checked or landed (`PIPELINE` in `scripts/worktree_fresh.py`), and names merged trees still here; `git fetch` at most every 5 minutes for the repository. Before an `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, `Write` or `NotebookEdit`, `edit-check` refuses a file of the primary checkout (links resolved; not a file git ignores, not `project-memory/`, not a tree's; `TM_EDIT_PRIMARY=1` at a session's start is the maintainer's own way past it); what it cannot judge it lets through. Only sessions in this repository: not `terminum hooks install`, not the package `bash-check`, on Bash, refuses the common shell writes in the primary checkout and git's verbs that change it, by reading the command (`scripts/shell_writes.py`): a heuristic, a program writing a file itself passes; `scripts/hooks/pre-commit` is its backstop when `CLAUDECODE` is set. Codex sets no such variable and runs no such hook: neither covers it, only CLAUDE.md §9 does. |

## Before a pull request

`make check` passes (CLAUDE.md §8; the browsers once: `cd ui && npx playwright-core install
chromium webkit`), and a change of behavior updates its spec first (CLAUDE.md §7; which spec:
[docs/README.md](docs/README.md)).
