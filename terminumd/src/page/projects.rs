//! Projects (AC-92, AC-110): named groups of sessions in the list, the same on every page, kept
//! in the tasks' store (tasks/projects.rs). Each has a name ("Group 1" …), a color of its own (the lowest of COLORS no
//! other project has: the page's palette, far apart), the host and folder of the session it
//! was made from (its [+] opens a window there) and its sessions by pane key, in the list's
//! order. A pane that closed leaves its project when its server's list is read (one added in
//! the last seconds is spared: a read on its way may not have it yet); a project with no
//! session left stays. A tmux server started anew numbers its panes anew: restored, its
//! sessions keep their projects (restore says which pane is which); else its panes leave
//! them, never naming other panes. A bookmark made in a project's session is the project's
//! (AC-33): orphaned once the project is deleted, or its session closes (bookmarks_scope.rs).
