//! What a coding agent's hooks said about a pane (AC-39, `terminum hook`): its state, the tool
//! it runs, what it waits for, its subagents. A hint with a lease, not the whole truth: an
//! interrupt in Claude Code fires no Stop and a crash no SessionEnd, so a working state no event
//! renewed for LEASE (a waiting one for WAIT_LEASE) gives way to the screen's reading again
//! (agentstate.rs), as does a pane whose program changed. A turn that stopped while its
//! subagents run (in the background) is working until the last of them stops (or BG_LEASE
//! passes without an event), through an idle notification and the next prompts: its end is
//! then, for reminders and unread. Hook events come out of order (they
//! run in the background): a working event of a turn that stopped changes nothing. A record that
//! went with a host's link or a restart comes back with its session's next event; a session seen
//! to end makes none. Codex has no
//! failure event and no question event: its done and its questions are the screen's.
