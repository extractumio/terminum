"""The input log (terminum.md AC-147) against a private terminumd and tmux: what a page types
gathers in a row until Enter, a paste is a row of its own, each with the page's browser, address
and the pane's machine, session and folder; a line begun with a space and what is typed at sudo's
password prompt keep only why they are not kept (the prompt is cancelled with Ctrl-C, nothing is
ever entered there); Dispatcher's launch and prompt are its rows, with its run, tasks and agent
(scripts/fake_agent.py as the agent).
