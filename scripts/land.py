"""Lands a finished worktree on origin/main (spec AC-104): merged with origin/main in the tree, its
smoke set green on that result, pushed, the primary checkout fast-forwarded and the tree deleted. Its
targeted checks passed on its own content count (scripts/check_changed.py records it); they run again
on the merged result when none is recorded or origin/main changed the same files. Several trees land at
once: each tests alone, and only the last look and the push take turns. A tree is merged with what
others landed meanwhile, its smoke set run again on each merge. During a release the primary checkout
stays where it is (scripts/release_turn.py), and the smoke set yields to it (nice).

  land.py <slug>    from the primary checkout (`make land SLUG=<slug>`), the work committed;
                    TM_LAND_INSTALL=1 (the maintainer's local.mk) also installs a change with code
Exit: 0 landed; 1 checks failed or refused (the tree stays); 2 a merge conflict, left in the tree
to resolve and commit before running this again. No force, ever."""
