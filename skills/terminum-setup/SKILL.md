description: Install, configure, check and repair terminum (a browser terminal workspace on private tmux servers) for the user on a Mac or a Ubuntu/Debian server, and connect Linux servers' tmux to it. Use when the user asks to install, set up, upgrade, configure, troubleshoot or uninstall terminum, add a remote host to it, or reach it from a phone.

# terminum setup

terminum runs `terminumd`, a server on `127.0.0.1:48080` that drives private tmux servers, and
shows them in a browser. You install it, check it and connect hosts; **the user** types the
password and answers macOS's prompts. Read the user's answers; never guess them.

## Rules for you, the agent

- Never type, choose, print, store or log the user's terminum password. It is set with
  `terminum password`, which reads it from a terminal: ask the user to run it themselves (in
  Claude Code: `! terminum password`). Never set `TM_WEB_PASSWORD`.
- Never read or copy `~/.terminum/state/` (sign-ins, tokens), never run `tailscale funnel`
  (the public internet: terminum refuses it anyway).
- Never end a tmux server (`tmux -L terminum kill-server`) or reboot without the user's go-ahead
  in this session: it ends every program running in terminum's terminals (coding agents too).
  Before one, take the snapshot in "Restarting terminum's tmux".
- Run as the user, never with `sudo` (the installer refuses root). Say what each step will do
  before an outward-facing one (`tailscale serve`, adding a host, installing packages).
- Report each command's real output; when a step fails, stop, show the message, and use
  "Troubleshooting" before trying anything else.

## 1. Check the machine

```bash
uname -s; uname -m                      # Darwin or Linux; arm64/aarch64 or x86_64
command -v tmux && tmux -V              # tmux 3.2 or newer
command -v terminum || ls ~/.terminum/bin/terminum 2>/dev/null   # already installed?
```

If terminum is installed, go to "Check it runs" and "Upgrade" instead of installing again.

## 2. Install

### On a Mac (macOS 14+)

```bash
brew install tmux                       # if tmux is missing (Homebrew: https://brew.sh)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/extractumio/terminum/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

During the install macOS asks on the Mac's screen whether terminum's terminals may read
Desktop, Documents, Downloads and each cloud folder (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive…). Tell the
user before you run it: "Click Allow on each prompt; macOS asks once." If the user is not at
the Mac, the install still finishes and says which prompts wait; `terminum folders` asks again
later. iCloud Drive is never asked for (macOS refuses it to every program without Full Disk
Access, which terminum does not need).

### On a Ubuntu/Debian server

```bash
sudo apt install -y tmux                # ask the user first: it needs their sudo
curl -fsSL https://github.com/extractumio/terminum/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

terminumd runs as a systemd user service. To keep it running after the user logs out and from
boot, the install prints a `sudo loginctl enable-linger <user>` line: ask the user before
running it. The page is on the server's `127.0.0.1:48080`: reach it with an ssh tunnel
(`ssh -L 48080:127.0.0.1:48080 <server>`, then `http://127.0.0.1:48080/` on the user's
computer) or with `tailscale serve` on the server (section 4).

### Both

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.terminum/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc    # or ~/.bashrc: the install's tip
export PATH="$HOME/.terminum/bin:$PATH"
```

Then ask the user to set the password every browser signs in with (8+ characters):
"Please run `terminum password` in your terminal (in Claude Code: `! terminum password`)."

## 3. Check it runs

```bash
terminum status
```

Expect `terminumd: running`, `password: set`, a `tmux:` line with sessions, and no `folders:`
line (on a Mac, that line means terminum's tmux must restart once: section 6). Then
`terminum open` on a Mac opens the page; the user signs in with the password.

Optional, when the user runs Claude Code or Codex in terminum: exact states, prompts and
reminders from their own hooks:

```bash
terminum hooks install
```

## 4. Other devices (a phone): Tailscale

Only when the user wants it and has Tailscale on both devices. Ask first: it publishes the page
to every device of the user's tailnet (each still signs in with the password).

```bash
tailscale serve --bg --https=443 http://127.0.0.1:48080
```

This takes the machine's tailnet name and replaces what its port 443 served: check
`tailscale serve status` first and keep another service there by giving terminum a name of its
own (docs/USAGE.md "Over Tailscale"). The page is then `https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net/`.

## 5. Connect a Linux server's tmux

The user's own tmux sessions on a server, over ssh, with its files (`--files`):

```bash
ssh <destination> 'tmux -V'             # must work without a prompt; tmux 3.2+ there
terminum hosts add <name> '<destination and ssh options>' --files
terminum hosts                          # its state: attached
```

`<destination>` is what the user types after `ssh` (`alex@devbox.example`, an alias from
`~/.ssh/config`, `-p 2222 alex@devbox.example`). terminum copies its files helper to the
server's `~/.terminum/bin/` and keeps it at its own version.

## 6. Restarting terminum's tmux (Mac, once)

`terminum status` saying "terminum's tmux was started by …" means macOS judges the terminals'
folders by an older program. One restart fixes it for good, but it ends every running program,
so only with the user's go-ahead and at a quiet moment:

1. Note what runs: `tmux -L terminum list-panes -a -F '#S #{pane_current_path} #{pane_current_command}'`
   (keep the output for the user).
2. `tmux -L terminum kill-server`. terminum makes the sessions again with their windows,
   splits, folders, projects, names, Unread marks and each terminal's last 300 lines within
   seconds; the programs do not come back.
3. Start the coding agents again in their folders (`claude --continue`, `codex resume --last`).
4. `terminum status`: no `folders:` line any more.

## 7. Upgrade, roll back, remove

```bash
terminum upgrade                        # the latest signed release; --to vX.Y.Z for one
terminum rollback                       # back to the build before
terminum uninstall                      # removes terminum; keeps ~/.terminum settings and state, tmux untouched
```

An upgrade restarts terminumd only: terminals and their programs keep running.

## Troubleshooting

| What you see | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| `tmux is needed for terminals` | Install tmux (`brew install tmux`, `sudo apt install tmux`), then `terminum restart`. |
| `port 48080 was held by another program` | Find it (`lsof -nP -iTCP:48080 -sTCP:LISTEN`), ask the user whether to stop it, then `terminum restart`. Or set another `port` in `~/.terminum/settings.json` and `terminum restart`. |
| `password: not set` | Ask the user to run `terminum password`. |
| A browser says "Signed out" | The user signs in with the password; `terminum signout` signs every browser out on purpose. |
| `Operation not permitted` in a terminal on a Mac (Documents, Desktop, …) | `terminum folders` (the user answers on the screen); a folder refused before: System Settings › Privacy & Security › Files and Folders › terminumd. Then section 6 if `terminum status` asks for it. |
| A host stays `connecting` or `down` | `ssh <destination> true` must work with no prompt; then `terminum hosts retry <name>`. |
| Anything else | `terminum logs -n 50` and `terminum status`; show the user the lines that say why. |
